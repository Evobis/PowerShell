# Evobis Customer PowerShell module

> [!NOTE]
> This library is in preview, and is subject to change.

This is a PowerShell library/module that is designed to aid [Evobis](https://evobis.dk) customers in managing their tenant.

These cmdlets aren't meant to be used for automations, but rather as a way to provide a simple interface to the more complex tasks that are often needed when working with development across Microsoft 365, such as managing permissions that don't yet have a GUI provided by Microsoft.

## Getting started

Read the [getting started](docs/Getting_Started.md) guide to get started with the library.

### TL;DR

Simply run the following command in a PowerShell **7.X**+ session:

```powershell
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evobis/PowerShell/refs/heads/main/main.ps1" | iex
```

## Cmdlets

See the full list of cmdlets in the [cmdlets docs](docs/cmdlets/index.md).

## Changelog

Please review the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for release details on all library changes.
